## The project

This React project was developed during Blipay's code testing. It allows the user to make loan simulations for themselves or their company.

All requests were mocked using MSW. Requests were made with react-query and axios. My focus with this project was to showcase state management with local storage and project configuration.

ESLint and Prettier were set up.

Testing was done with Jest and react-testing-library.

The styles were created with styled-components, and the fonts were imported from Google Fonts.
